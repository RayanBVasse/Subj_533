Phase A — What the data shows (facts, not interpretation)

Input integrity

Rows analyzed: 531
All rows correspond to USER messages only
Normalized NRC → composite affect → rolling volatility
No truncation, no contamination, no black box

Quantitative results (from the file)
Emotional volatility levels
Negative volatility (mean): ~0.00017
Positive volatility (mean): ~0.00056

➡ Positive affect shows higher absolute volatility than negative affect.

Variability
Negative volatility SD: ~0.00024
Positive volatility SD: ~0.00061

➡ Positive emotional expression fluctuates more strongly and more often than negative emotional expression.

Longitudinal trend (entry_index as time)
Negative volatility trend: ~0 (correlation ≈ +0.04)
→ essentially stable over time
Positive volatility trend: negative correlation ≈ −0.28
→ clear downward trend
➡ Over time, positive emotional volatility decreases, while negative volatility remains relatively flat.

Interpretation (strictly grounded)
No emotional destabilization
There is no upward drift in negative volatility.
This argues against progressive emotional dysregulation across the corpus.

Progressive emotional stabilization
The declining positive volatility suggests:
reduced emotional swings
increased affective consistency
This is a regulation signal, not emotional flattening.

Asymmetry matters
Stability is achieved not by suppressing negativity,
but by dampening positive oscillations.
That pattern is consistent with reflective settling rather than mood collapse.
